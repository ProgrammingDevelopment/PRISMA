# PRISMA Project

This project has been restructured into two main components:

1. **central-node**: Contains the backend services (Python, Go, Dotnet) and core logic.
2. **frontend-ai-features**: Contains the Next.js frontend application with AI features.

## Getting Started

To work on the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend-ai-features
npm run dev
```

To work on the backend, refer to the documentation in `central-node`.
